Stat Semantics Definition

    The only static semantics we impose that can be processed by the compiler (static) are proper use of variables.

    Variables
        Variables have to be defined before used first time (must satisfy syntax too)
        Variable name can only be defined once in a scope but can be reused in another scope. There are two options for scope

Two options for variable scope. You must include README.txt file listing on the first line either Global or Local to indicate your chosen scope option. If this info is missing projects will be tested and graded as global.

    Global option for variables (75)
        There is only one scope, the global scope, in the case, regardless of where variable is defined
    Local option for variables (100)
        Variables outside of a block are global
        Variables in a given block are scoped in this block
        Rules as in C (smaller scope hides the outer/global scope variable)
