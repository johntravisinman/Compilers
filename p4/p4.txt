Invocation

comp [file]

where file is as before. Wrong invocations will not be graded.
Details

The program is to parse the input, generate a parse tree, perform static semantics, and then generate a target file. Any error should display detailed message, including line number if available (depending on scanner).

The target name should be

    out.asm if keyboard input
    file.asm if file input. The base name matches that of the input file

The program has 2 parts to be properly generated:

    Code generation
        100
    Storage allocation - Local (60) or Global option (40)
        Global - all variables allocated globally.
        Local - variables outside of a block are scoped in the entire program, variables in a block are scoped in that block

Note that this does not have to match your static semantics but local storage will use the same mechanisms as local semantics.

An included README.txt file must say Storage=Global or Local on the first line. Otherwise global will be assumed.

Temporary variables can processed as global scope even when doing local scoping for user variables.

Upon success, only display the name of the target file. Upon error and the error message, no other display and no target should be generated.
